## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: ZUS Green (#00993F) for the header and 'Przejd≈∫ do symulacji' CTA to align with the ZUS branding and evoke trust.
- Background color: Light green (#E5F3E9), a desaturated tint of the primary green, provides a calm and familiar background, keeping the ZUS association without overwhelming the interface.
- Accent color: ZUS Orange (#FFB34F) for interactive elements and to highlight the 'Zapisz oczekiwanie' CTA, drawing attention to actionable items; also used for visual alerts like exceeding maximum deposit.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to ensure readability and a modern feel paired with 'Playfair' (serif) for titles to create an elegant but still approachable feeling.
- Grid layout: Desktop version uses a 2-column grid; left (2/3 width) for the question and graph, and right (1/3 width) for the 'Ciekawostka dnia' panel. Mobile adapts to a single-column layout for better viewing on smaller screens.
- Simple, recognizable icons for the refresh and info buttons, using a style consistent with accessibility and ease of understanding.
- Subtle animations on the loading of the 'Ciekawostka dnia' and the graph to add a dynamic feel without distracting from the main information.
